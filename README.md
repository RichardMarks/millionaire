# millionaire

A very simple game by Richard Marks

+ present the user with a greeting
+ tell the user they have $10 and the goal is to get $1,000,000
+ get a random number between 1 and 6 inclusive and store as targetNumber
+ ask the user to bet between $1 and $N (where N is the amount of $ the user has)
+ ask the user to guess a number by entering a number from 1 to 6
+ if user entered the targetNumber, reward user with their bet $ * 2
+ if user entered the wrong number, tell the user they lost the bet
+ if user $ >= $1,000,000 then the game is over with a win
+ if user $ <= 0 then the game is over with a loss
+ tell user if they won or lost and ask if they want to play again
+ if they want to play again, restart the game otherwise end program
